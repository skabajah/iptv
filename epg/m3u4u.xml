<desc lang="en">Created in 1997 by veteran journalist Barbara Walters, "The View" is a daytime talk show hosted by women -- including Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro -- and each offers her take on the day's news during the opening "Hot Topics" segment. Later, the ladies welcome various celebrities, who join them in a chat or perform for the audience. The program also offers tips on beauty, fashion, diet and relationships. Known for their freewheeling style, the hosts are often lampooned in late-night sketches.</desc>

Hosted by Curt Menefee and Terry Bradshaw alongside analysts Howie Long, Jimmy Johnson and Michael Strahan, it includes news, features, highlights and predictions. Jay Glazer provides "insider" information. The signature pregame show, which premiered alongside Fox's NFL coverage in 1994, has remained surprisingly consistent with much of its cast over the years, with Bradshaw, Long and Johnson all members of the original lineup when the show debuted.</desc>
